> Responsive tools for your Ember app

## Install ##

````bash
ember install ui-responsive
````

## Usage ##

### Responsive Service ###

You can insert the responsive service into your component, controller, [ fill in the blank ] by:

````js
Component.extend({
    responsive: inject.service();
})
````

Now you can reference the services various information services including:

- *viewport* - get height, width, and a "name":
- *screen* - the total and available screen real estate on the users system (not the browsers)
- *body* - height, width of the body element

Also there is a simple `width` and `height` properties which are aliases to the viewport properties.

There is also now a handy breakpoint naming convention supported too. The default configuration is:

````javascript
[
  { id: 'mobile', max: 768},
  { id: 'tablet', min: 768, max: 992 },
  { id: 'desktop', min: 992, max: 1200 },
  { id: 'large', min: 1200, max: 1899 },
  { id: 'huge', min: 1900 }
];
````

You can set this to whatever you like by:

````javascript
this.responsive.setBreakpoints(myBrilliantBreakpoints);
````

Now you'll see that the has a set of boolean flags like `isMobile`, `isTablet`, etc. which indicate the state you are in. As a convenience you can also get a string name back for the breakpoint size with the `deviceType` property.

## Demo

For an interactive demo (you'll have to change your screen size to make it be *interactive*): [ui-responsive-toolbelt](https://ui-responsive-toolbelt.firebaseapp.com/).

This probably works with older versions of Ember and Ember-CLI but it was intended for:

- Ember 1.13.0+
- Ember-CLI 1.13.13+
